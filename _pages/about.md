# Hi! I'm Justice Ogbonna

I am a Software Engineer by day and entrepreneur by night. I have some experience developing websites and mobile apps and have graced the partnership of startups and small businesses. I have tinkered with research and machine learning too.

Some broad areas of interest to me include:

* Prevention and eradication of malaria and its vector - mosquito - from sub-saharan Africa and beyond.

* Re-imagining technological innovation for developing countries, as opposed to adapting existing technology for them.

* Making education more relevant to the needs of developing economies and educational resources more accessible.
